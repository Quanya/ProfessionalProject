									<p>You make it so difficult sometimes. You have your moments. Not many of them, but you do have them. You're not actually going IN to an asteroid field? I happen to like nice men. This bucket of bolts's never gonna get us past that blockade. We're going to get pulverized if we stay out here much longer. Evacuate remaining ground staff.</p>

									<h3>I hope it's for adult dating</h3>
									<p>Can we talk? OK, we all know Prince Valium is a pill. But you could have married him for your father's sake and had a headache for the next 25 years. Well, goodbye virgin alarm. Besides he got a sexy voice. He might be cute. Hey wait, you forgot to get married! And if we go over our pagecount, the network will kill us. You know, you've got a very unique voice. You should be in silent films.</p>
